# The universal Mastodon/GNU Social instance blacklist
This repository keeps track of 'bad' GNU Social-compatible instances, which
fails to conform to the rules against harassment, spam, etc.

It shall document exactly why it was added, in order to eliminate confusion
around it.

# FAQ
**What rules should the instances conform to?** See below.

**Is this list political?** Unless you consider racism, sexism, spam, or
harassment a form of politics, then no. This isn't supposed to be a political
blacklist. If you think we added an instance for political reasons, please open
an issue and we will discuss.

**Where can I find the plaintext list?** In the `list.txt` file.

**What can I use this for?** Whatever you like. Examples: as a blacklist for
your server.

**What is the point of blocking?** The first reason is of course to avoid
unwanted content. But equally important is to discourage usage of these
instances. Because Mastodon is decentralized, there is no way you can do this
globally, so you'll have to use an exclusion-based approach, which this lists
tries to provide.

# Rules
If the instance does any of the following, it will be added to this list:

- actively refuses to ban people advocating for violence against children.
- actively refuses to ban people who harass people from other instances¹.
- actively refuses to ban advocates of racism, sexism, fascism, or other
  ideology which discriminate based on arbitrary measures.
- actively refuses to ban spammers.
- actively refuses to ban child pornography or dispictions of that.
- actively refuses to remove untagged pornographic content.
- does not respect privacy of its users.
- attempts to extract profits² of its service.
- lacks basic moderation³.
- fails to comply with [mastodon.social's
  rules](https://mastodon.social/about/more) of conduct with users from other
  instances.

¹The policy within the instance is not important for the list. We encourage the
user to ensure that the policy is right for them before they sign up.

²does not include donations, as long as it is not excessive or obstructing for
the user's experience.

³i.e. fails to comply with above requirements.
